              Elan Exports Consultancy (EEC) was established to simplify international sourcing by helping businesses identify reliable manufacturing partners and build resilient supply chains. Headquartered in Singapore, EEC combines procurement expertise with a global supplier network to support buyers across a wide range of industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than operating as a marketplace, EEC works as a strategic sourcing consultancy, supporting supplier identification, supplier qualification, procurement coordination and sourcing strategy. Our approach is built on transparency, collaboration and long-term business relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              While EEC has developed extensive sourcing expertise and a strong supplier network across India and Asia, we also work with verified manufacturers in other global markets to meet our clients' sourcing requirements.
