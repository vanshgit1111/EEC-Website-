const FAQ = [
  { q: "What is Elan Exports Consultancy?", a: `Elan Exports Consultancy (EEC) is a Singapore Headquartered global sourcing consultancy that connects buyers with verified manufacturers worldwide, backed by specialised expertise and an extensive sourcing network across India and Asia. EEC delivers open-book commercials and predictable shipments. Founded with 20 years of founder experience and incorporated on ${COMPANY.incorporationDateDisplay} (UEN: ${COMPANY.uen}), EEC acts as an embedded sourcing arm for global buyers.` },
  { q: "What countries does EEC source from?", a: "EEC sources from India, Asia and select global markets. India remains the primary sourcing market across food commodities, textiles, fresh produce, processed foods, hospital textiles and eco-friendly products. EEC also works with verified manufacturers in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and other countries based on category requirements. Every supplier in the network is verified before any RFQ is deployed to a buyer." },
  { q: "How is EEC different from a sourcing marketplace?", a: "EEC is a consultancy, not a marketplace. Marketplaces earn revenue from supplier listings or transaction commissions. EEC charges buyers a service fee based on engagement tier. EEC negotiates on open-book terms. Suppliers are recommended based on quality and fit, with no commercial conflict of interest." },
  { q: "What is landed cost, and how does EEC model it?", a: "Landed cost is the total cost of a product at the destination warehouse, including factory price (FOB), freight, insurance, import duties, customs clearance and last-mile delivery. EEC provides open-book landed cost modelling for every sourcing project before the buyer commits to a supplier. This eliminates hidden margins and gives procurement teams an accurate, comparable basis for supplier decisions across categories and geographies." },
  { q: "How are suppliers vetted by EEC?", a: `We take a focused approach to sourcing. Every supplier in our network is carefully vetted through due diligence and ongoing evaluation, ensuring global buyers have access to reliable manufacturers, transparent commercial practices and dependable supply chains. The vetting process covers IEC registration, GST filing, financial checks, factory audits and compliance documentation. Every approved supplier has a written EEC audit report on file. EEC currently works with ${COMPANY.supplierCountClaim} across active categories.` },
  { q: "What product categories does EEC source?", a: "EEC operates six active sourcing desks: Food Commodities (rice, sugar, pulses, edible oils, spices), Processed and Packaged Foods (snacks, beverages, frozen foods, ready meals), Fresh and Agricultural Products (fruits, vegetables, organic produce), Healthcare and Hospital Textile Supplies (patient gowns, scrubs, surgical drapes, hospital bed linen, institutional uniforms), Home Textile, Apparel and Hospitality Products (bed linen, towels, uniforms, hotel amenities) and Eco-Friendly, Sustainable and Organic Products (biodegradable packaging, organic textiles).", link: "/categories", linkText: "See all categories" },
  { q: "How does EEC price its services?", a: "EEC pricing varies by engagement tier. Scout is a fixed-fee one-time project for buyers evaluating a new category or geography. Engage (per-project) and Embed (quarterly retainer) are priced during the discovery call based on category complexity, volume and sourcing geography. EEC does not charge suppliers listing or activation fees at any stage. All revenue comes from buyer service fees only. Pricing is shared at the discovery call and is not published publicly." },
  { q: "Is EEC headquartered in Singapore?", a: `Yes. ${COMPANY.legalName} is incorporated in Singapore under UEN ${COMPANY.uen}, registered on ${COMPANY.incorporationDateDisplay} at ${COMPANY.addressFull}. The company is Singapore Headquartered. Procurement, sourcing and operations teams are based in India.` },
  { q: "What certifications does EEC check for European food buyers?", a: "Certification requirements vary by category. Food commodity and frozen food suppliers require FSSAI, HACCP and BRC/BRCGS as a baseline, with EU Health Certificates for frozen seafood. Organic food suppliers require EU Organic or NPOP equivalence. Ethnic and packaged food suppliers require IFS Food for German and French buyers and Halal certification where applicable. FSSC 22000 is accepted as a BRC equivalent by most EU buyers across all categories.", link: "/for-buyers", linkText: "Full certification requirements by category" },
  { q: "How do I start working with EEC as a buyer?", a: "The fastest way to start is a free 20-minute discovery call with no commitment required. EEC maps your sourcing category, target landed cost, compliance requirements and timelines. After the call, EEC recommends the appropriate engagement tier and provides a scope and pricing outline within 2 working days. Buyers can also submit a sourcing brief directly through the EEC Buyer Portal, which takes under 5 minutes to complete." },
