const FAQ = [
  ["What is the EEC Supplier Network?", "The EEC Supplier Network is a curated network of verified manufacturers connected with procurement teams through Elan Exports Consultancy. As a Singapore Headquartered global sourcing consultancy, EEC facilitates international sourcing opportunities across multiple categories, with particular expertise in India and Asia."],
  ["Who can apply to join the EEC Supplier Network?", "Manufacturers and producers across the six EEC active categories are welcome to apply. We evaluate suppliers based on manufacturing capability, product quality, export readiness, compliance standards and alignment with buyer requirements. Trading and re-export businesses are not eligible."],
  ["How does EEC qualify suppliers?", "EEC qualifies suppliers through a structured five-stage process: valid IEC and GST registration, established manufacturing operations with a proven export history (trading and re-export businesses are not eligible), factory audit-readiness with BSCI or SEDEX audit scheduled within 90 days of network activation, a documented quality management system (ISO 9001 preferred), and demonstrated export experience to North America, Europe, the Middle East or Asia-Pacific markets. Every qualifying supplier receives an EEC audit report that is shared with buyers, not a cold directory profile."],
  ["Do I need all certifications to apply to EEC?", "No. You do not need every certification at application stage. Factory audit-readiness is what qualifies you. Specifically, willingness to schedule a BSCI or SEDEX audit within 90 days of network activation. EEC provides a certification roadmap during onboarding, aligned to the specific buyer markets your category targets."],
  ["Does joining the EEC Supplier Network guarantee orders?", "No. Joining the EEC Supplier Network does not guarantee purchase orders or contracts. Qualified suppliers may be considered for relevant sourcing opportunities when their products, capabilities and commercial offering align with buyer requirements."],
  ["Which countries and industries does EEC serve?", "EEC active sourcing categories are: Food Commodities, Processed and Packaged Foods, Fresh and Agricultural Products, Healthcare and Hospital Textile Supplies, Home Textile, Apparel and Hospitality Products, and Eco-Friendly, Sustainable and Organic Products. Buyers span procurement teams across the EU, US, Canada, Middle East and Asia-Pacific."],
  ["Does EEC work only with suppliers from India and Asia?", "The EEC primary supplier network is across India, with select verified manufacturers in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand. Suppliers from other markets may be considered for specific buyer requirements on a case-by-case basis."],
  ["What makes EEC different from a B2B marketplace?", "EEC is a sourcing consultancy, not a marketplace. Buyer-fee model, open-book costs, no supplier listing fees. We work closely with buyers and suppliers throughout the sourcing process. Learn more", "/about"],
